# High Performance Computing — Spring 2016

Lecture slides, assignments and class reading will be posted here. I will also maintain a class schedule here. I suggest cloning this repo and updating it periodically. Lecture slides will be uploaded after the class.

# Submission of HWs:
1. Create a private github repo:	name-hpc2016 *Refer to https://education.github.com for instructions on obtaining a private repo from github*
2. Add me as a collaborator to the repo -  **sharmaashish**
3. Create folders per assignment: HW1/HW2… *This is case sensitive*
4. Commit your assignment to the appropriate folder

I will checkout your latest commit made on or before the due date. Always include a brief README.md with instructions on how to test your code
